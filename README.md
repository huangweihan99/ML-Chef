# ML-Chef

The ML-Chef data application consists of two GPT-2 models fine-tuned for the purpose of recipe generation and ingredient recommendation. These two models work in unison to take in a list of ingredients from the user, optionally recommend additional complementary ingredients, and generate customised recipes that maximally utilise the input ingredients. The high-level system diagram of the data application is shown below:

The ML-Chef data application was developed to achieve the following goals:

* Reduce food wastage
* Encourage culinary exploration

## User Guide

To launch and use the data application follow the steps listed below:
1. Clone the ML-Chef GitHub repository.
2. Replace the pre-trained model file paths in the functions `load_recipe_model` and `load_ingredient_model` to those corresponding to your local device:

```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_ingredient_model():
    """Loads ingredient recommendation model and caches it"""
    ingredient_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(r"Replace with ingredient model file path")
    ingredient_model = ingredient_model.to(device)
    
    return ingredient_model

@st.cache_resource
def load_recipe_model():
    """Loads recipe generation model and caches it"""
    recipe_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(r"Replace with recipe model file path")
    recipe_model = recipe_model.to(device)
    
    return recipe_model
```

3. Install the necessary libraries such as streamlit and transformers.

```python
pip install streamlit
pip install transformers
```

4. Navigate to the ML-Chef directory in your terminal and enter the command `streamlit run main.py` to launch the data app.
5. Select common pantry ingredients to use from the drop-down menu.
6. Enter other input ingredients in the text-entry field in **CSV format**.
7. Use the ingredient recommendation model to recommend additional complementary ingredients by selecting the **Augment Ingredient List** option.
8. Finalize the input ingredients to the recipe generation model by clicking the **Compile Ingredient List** button.

9. After compiling the ingredient list, you can adjust the generation hyperparameters using the sliders and then click the **Generate Recipe** button. This process takes a while (âˆ¼ 35s).
10. After the recipe has been generated, you have the option to save the recipe to your local device by clicking the **Download Recipe** button.

11. When following the recipe, use the unit conversion widget located in the side bar to convert any quantities.
